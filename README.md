# My Photonic Component Library (Adiabatic Components)

This repository provides a showcase of the photonic components I designed throughout my Ph.D. These components can be categorized as power splitters, fiber-to-chip light couplers, mode converters, polarization rotators, and Si-to-SiN light couplers. The GDS files of these devices are given, along with experimental results for most of these components.


## Power Splitters
### 1x2 Power Splitters (Y-Junction Power Splitters)
Here I present my 1x2 power splitter designs and their experimental results. I have designed 2 power splitters, one for an e-beam lithography based fabrication run (for Advanced Micro Foundry, Alberta, Canada) with 120 nm minimum feature size, another for a DUV lithography with CMOS foundry (AMF, Singapore) with 180 nm minimum feature size.

Highlights of the 1x2 Y-Junction power splitters: 
- Low losses
- Broadband
- Polarization insensitivity
- Large minimum feature sizes
- Strong fabrication tolerance
- Much shorter than their adiabatic counterparts!

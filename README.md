# My Photonic Component Library (Adiabatic Components)

This repository provides a showcase of the photonic components I designed throughout my Ph.D. These components can be categorized as power splitters, fiber-to-chip light couplers, mode converters, polarization rotators, and Si-to-SiN light couplers. The GDS files of these devices are given, along with experimental results for most of these components.

## Fiber-to-Chip Light Couplers
Here I present my adiabatic inverse taper-based fiber-to-chip light coupler designs. 

Highlights of the fiber-to-chip light couplers: 
- Low losses around 1550 nm (<1 dB)
- Dual polarization operation
- Broadband
- Short device length (15 um)
- Strong fabrication error tolerance
- Low performance variation between chips

## Power Splitters
### 1x2 Power Splitters (Y-Junction Power Splitters)
Here I present my 1x2 power splitter designs and their experimental results. I have designed 2 power splitters, one for an e-beam lithography based fabrication run (for Advanced Micro Foundry, Alberta, Canada) with 120 nm minimum feature size, another for a DUV lithography with CMOS foundry (AMF, Singapore) with 180 nm minimum feature size.

Highlights of the 1x2 Y-Junction power splitters: 
- Low losses
- Broadband
- Polarization insensitivity
- Large minimum feature sizes
- Strong fabrication tolerance
- Much shorter than their adiabatic counterparts!

## TM<sub>0</sub> to TE<sub>1</sub> Mode Converters
The TM<sub>0</sub> to TE<sub>1</sub> adiabatic mode converter was proposed and realized in [this paper](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-22-4-3777&id=279346) as a 100 micron long device. [A later work](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/4/3/030803/123597) achieved a length of 40 microns. Here, I show my design, which has a length of 18 microns and very low (<0.1 dB) mode conversion losses:

## Untested & Unpublished Devices
Here are some devices which I have not had the time to get fabricated or tested. I limit the amount of information about these devices in case I decide to fabricated and test these devices.

### Polarization Rotator/Splitter

### Si-to-SiN Light Coupler

# My_photonic_component_library

This repository provides a showcase of the photonic components I designed throughout my Ph.D. These components are power splitters, fiber-to-chip light couplers, mode converters, polarization rotators, and Si-to-SiN light couplers. The GDS files of these devices are given, along with experimental results for most of these components.
